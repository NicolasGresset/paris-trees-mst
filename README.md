# paris-trees-mst

This project is an academical project which aims to compute minimum spanning tree algorithm on Paris trees from a csv database.

One year after, I come back on the database to try to enhance coding quality and review my past mistakes.

## to be modified

- CLI parsing, use [vrgcli](https://dev.to/rdentato/vrg-for-comand-lines-5hmm), it seems easier
- gui library : use sdl2 instead, more universal and portable

taking a first look at the basecode shows there are plenty of modifications to be done !

A test framework needs to be used, why not [this one](https://github.com/rdentato/tst/blob/main/src/tst.h)
let's write some unit tests
